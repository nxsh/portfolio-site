Return true if the character 'a' is always followed by another character 'a'.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples: 'aabc' returns true, and 'abab' returns false.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Task 2:</h1>\n<p>There are 'n' coins, each showing either heads or tails. We would like all the coins to form a sequence of alternating heads and tails. What is the minimum number of coins that must be reversed to achieve this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples: [1,0,1,0,1,1] returns 1 (only last coin must be flipped)</li>\n<li>Note: alternating binary bits, count the differences for swapping 1's or 0's and take the minimum</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Task 3:</h1>\n<p>You are given a string 'S'. Deletion of the k-th letter of S costs C[k]. After deleting a letter the costs of deleting other letters do not change. You want to delete some letters from S to obtain a string without two identical letters next to each other. What is the minimum total cost of deletions to achieve such a string?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples: for S='ab' and C = [1,3], after deleting 'a', deletion of 'b' will still cost 3\n<ul>\n<li>S = 'abccbd', C=[0,1,2,3,4,5], should return 2. Removing first occurence of 'c' achieves 'abcbd'</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Task 4:</h1>\n<p>Given a string to be parsed in CSV format \"id,name,age,job\\n1,Jill,24,Scientist\\n2,Ryan,23,Developer\\n3,Charlie,NULL,Researcher\" that produces the following table:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Id</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Age</th>\n<th>Job</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Jill</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>Scientist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Ryan</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>Developer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Charlie</td>\n<td>NULL</td>\n<td>Researcher</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If a row's field has a cell <em>exactly</em> equal to 'NULL', remove that row from the input string</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples: \"id,name,age,job\\n1,Jill,24,Scientist\\n2,Ryan,23,Developer\\n3,Charlie,NULL,Researcher\" becomes \"id,name,age,job\\n1,Jill,24,Scientist\\n2,Ryan,23,Developer\"</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Id</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Age</th>\n<th>Job</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Jill</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>Scientist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Ryan</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>Developer</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Note that rows containing 'null' as part of a word such as 'Anulled' or 'ANULLED' must <strong>not</strong> be deleted, or rows with 'null' in lowercase</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Task 5:</h1>\n<p>Given two arrays of dice rolls, e.g. [1,2,3] and [2,4,6], create a function that takes in these arrays and changes them to equal the <strong>same total amount</strong> (if possible) in the <strong>minimum</strong> amount of changes possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note: greedy algorithm suitable here</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Results</h1>\n<p>I was allotted 120 minutes to complete all 5 tasks, and managed to pass all tests for tasks 1-4, but did not manage to complete the final task.</p>\n<p>This was my first ever timed-coding assessment and 4/5 was enough to progress to the next stage of video assessments.</p>\n<p>The experience has given me a lot of confidence for future coding tests, and I have been enjoying my time practicing on Leetcode and similar sites.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2021-01-23-sky-coding-test"}},
