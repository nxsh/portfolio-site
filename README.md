[Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM)

# Todo 
- [x] Responsive PDF
- [] Learn Flexbox for layout

- [] Hamburger menu for mobile
- [] Light/dark mode
- [] Create an email form on contact page
- [x] Remove window controls from code snippet

# Improvements

* Use folders for markdown files
* Implement blog tags/categories
* Clean up CSS files/classes
* Remove redundant CSS
* Set up Contentful using the guide, very useful if I create a blog for other people

# Notes
* Date format within the project and in file names is YYYY/MM/DD
    - To show it in the UK way I transform from this format
* Node is telling me there are tons of vulnerabilities, apparently this is okay?
* CSS changes:
    - New fonts
    - H1-6 are no longer bold, weight is 400
    - H1 and H2 are same size
