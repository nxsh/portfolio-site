In the UK, it is common for graduate roles - often termed grad schemes - to involve several stages for applicants. 

The first few stages often involve psychometric/aptitude tests that focus on a candidate's ability to reason from data, for technical positions there is a focus on numerical reasoning. 

Numerical reasoning tests generally provide a candidate with data in the form of figures and graphs, and require them to extrapolate additional information from them. 

# Example - Increase a number by a percentage: 
Sky had 22584250 total customers last year, this year it is expected to have an increase of 8%. What will the total customers be for this year?

Method: Increase 22584250 by 8%

  Steps:<br>
  1. Calculate 1% of original: 22584250 / 100 = 225842.5<br>
  2. Calculate an 8% increase: 225842.5 * 8 = 1806740<br>
  3. Add to original: 1806740 + 22584250 = 24390990

# Example 2 - A number as a percentage of a larger number: 
By what percentage has the total Sky customers increased from 2018-2019?

Sky customers 2018: 21068400 
Sky customers 2019: 22584250 

Method: Calculate the difference between the two numbers as a percentage of the original

   Steps:<br>
   1. Find out difference of new number and original: 22584250 - 21068400 = 1515850 <br>
   2. Find out what the difference is as a percentage of the original number (1515850 / 21068400) * 100 = 7.1948985210077657 <br>
   3. Round (if required) = 7%
