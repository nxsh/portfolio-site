A personal or portfolio site is something I would recommend everyone has. While there are many options for third-party hosting and email servers, this post will detail how I set up a personal website on my own web server, with a mail server. 

Previously I used a combination of Github Pages, CloudFlare, and MXRoute to achieve a HTTPS secured personal blog and secure email server, but I thought it would be both interesting and educational to to set up my very own corner of the internet independent of these services.
