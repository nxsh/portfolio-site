Effort. This can be the difference between satisfaction for an achievement, or a sense of fraud (or even *imposter syndrome*).

My relationship with effort throughout my life has never been brilliant. From late primary school (think year 5 or 6) it was never *cool* to try hard with schoolwork. 
This carried on throughout secondary school where I always put in the minimum amount of effort I could to stay in the top classes and in doing so, developed an extremely poor work ethic.

Homework due on a day would be completed either in the hours before I slept the day before, or even during the beginning of the lesson it was due for. 

I believe this was a result of being able to do well without much effort and also because the majority of friends I had during secondary school were not academic and I had an easier life not being seen as a **nerd**.
This led to me leaving exam revision until a day or so before the exam. Doing this I had no stress or worries until the final moments, where I would be fuelled entirely by anxiety and a fear of failure. 

Years later I have realised that while I may have believed I was doing this for the above reasons, it was really because I'd never once tried my absolute best. It is truly terrifying to me to put my all into something and not being as good as I believe I should be at it. 

Over years it seems I developed an extremely unhealthy view on both effort and intelligence, this being that if I am a smart person, I shouldn't need to expend any effort in learning. Now that I am at university this view and my poor work ethic have made things very difficult for me. 
Before university level I could get away with doing relatively little work and still do well, but degree level content is *designed to be challenging*, otherwise what's the point of paying so much money?

A side effect of this mentality was that I would feel a sense of fraud with my achievements, as I never felt like I had put my all into anything, I didn't feel as though I deserved the accomplishments, that I was a fraud. Life passed by without any hardships or struggles academically, without me developing good lifelong habits. 

Unfortunately the beliefs my schoolteachers enforced were that grades were the only important thing, not learning useful things and enjoying the process. This killed the enjoyment of learning for me and was likely partly responsible for my immense fear of failure. I never felt as though I was at school to learn things I enjoy, just to pass exams.

Ultimately I felt that I was not there to learn because I wanted to learn, I felt to so pressured to do well in exams that I could never **enjoy** studying, it was something I hated because of the anxiety it gave rise to. As I am right now, this has resulted in me being afraid of difficult content, even though I have a desire to learn it.
