I recently purchased one of Apple's new M1 chip MacBook Airs, and I will say I have been nothing short of impressed.

I moved from a ThinkPad T480 I ran Linux on - which also served me incredibly well - but wow, the screen alone is leaps and bounds ahead. 

This post details my setup steps.

# Mac Setup

## Mac Preferences
- Change touchpad to tap to click
- Finder view status bar and path bar
- Configure Apple ID and TouchID
- Set up 1Pass
- Login to websites/apps
- Set up email accounts
- Install homebrew
  - `sudo chown -R /usr/local/*` to fix permissions
- Arrange folders by default by kind 
  - In Finder select 'Show View Options' then sort by kind or any other options
  - Tick use as defaults
  - Delete all .DS_Store files, they contain the icon layouts
  - `sudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete; killall Finder`
- Set safari homepage to Start Page
- Set screenshot directory: `defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Photos/Screenshots`
- As I store a lot of my data with iCloud, often I need to delete the `.icloud` files when I have moved them to local storage
  - This also means adding `.*.*.icloud` to the `.gitignore` file of any repos I clone from iCloud to local storage
